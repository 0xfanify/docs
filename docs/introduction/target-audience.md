## Target Audience

Fanify is designed to serve multiple user segments, each with distinct motivations and needs:

* **Sports Fans and Passionate Supporters:** Individuals deeply engaged with football (and eventually other sports) who seek a more interactive and meaningful way to support their teams. They value community-driven experiences and the emotional connection of shared sentiment.

* **Crypto-Native Bettors:** Users familiar with crypto and blockchain technologies, actively seeking innovative, transparent betting platforms with additional earning potential. They value the trustlessness, security, and decentralization enabled by smart contract infrastructure.

* **Fan Token Holders:** Members of the Chiliz and fan token ecosystems looking to maximize the utility of their digital assets. They seek opportunities for staking, yield farming, and participation rewards that increase the value of their tokens while deepening team engagement.

* **DeFi Enthusiasts:** Users immersed in decentralized finance, eager for novel yield-generating strategies and investment mechanics within the context of sports betting. They are motivated by composability, smart contract yield flows, and innovative DeFi primitives.
