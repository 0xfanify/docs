## What is Hype-Based Betting?

**Hype-Based Betting** is the core innovation of our platform, redefining how sports betting is conceptualized and executed. Instead of relying solely on traditional statistical analysis or the subjective judgment of centralized oddsmakers, this model integrates collective sentiment and public perception derived from social media platforms.

In this system, "hype"—the momentum, enthusiasm, or concern expressed across platforms like Twitter and Discord—is collected, processed, and transformed into a quantifiable metric. This **Hype Score** captures the real-time emotional pulse of the community surrounding a specific team or event.

The resulting metric directly influences the calculation of betting odds, making them dynamic rather than static. Odds evolve continuously up to match kickoff, reflecting shifts in public sentiment in real time.

This approach creates a betting experience that is:

* **Transparent** – Odds are driven by publicly observable data.
* **Engaging** – Fans can collectively shape the market through their voice.
* **Interactive** – Social momentum directly impacts outcomes, blending fandom with financial participation.

Hype-Based Betting transforms passive speculation into an active, decentralized dialogue—bridging Web3 infrastructure with the emotional intensity of sports culture.
