* **Chiliz Chain Total Value Locked (TVL):**
  Approximately **$6.57 million**, with FanX protocol contributing about **$5.82 million** to this figure ([defillama.com][1], [defillama.com][2]).

* **APR/Yield Rates:**
  FanX currently offers **incredibly high APRs**, with some pools advertising up to **4,781.29%**, though yields may vary based on the specific team‚Äôs performance and pool liquidity ([x.com][3]).

### ‚úÖ Yield Farming Flow & Benefits

When users stake Fan Tokens for a season:

1. **Liquidity Provisioning:**
   Fan tokens are deposited into FanX‚Äôs liquidity pools, pairing with stable or native assets.

2. **Reward Accrual:**
   Stakers earn:

   * A share of **transaction fees** from trades in the pool.
   * Additional **incentives and bonus yields** from FanX, often boosted for high-profile teams.

3. **Token Multiplication:**
   At the end of the season, users **unstake** and receive:

   * Their **original Fan Token** stake.
   * **Yield-generated rewards**, increasing their total balance.

4. **Risk Consideration:**
   All earned yield and original stake are **only accessible if $HYPE remains positive**. Losing all $HYPE in bets renders the farmed tokens unrecoverable.
