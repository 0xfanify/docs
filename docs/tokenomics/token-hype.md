The **$HYPE token** is the core settlement asset within the Fanify betting ecosystem, functioning as the exclusive currency for placing bets and distributing rewards. It is a **non-transferable, dollar-pegged ERC-20 token**, minted through staking and burned through participation in the betting process.

## $HYPE Mechanics & Utility

* **Staking-Based Minting:**
  The only way to mint $HYPE is by staking either **CHZ** or **Fan Tokens** via the platform’s smart contracts. No external purchase is allowed.

* **Betting Currency:**
  All users—whether staking CHZ or Fan Tokens—place their bets using $HYPE. It serves as the universal unit of account for all matches.

* **Reward Distribution:**
  Winnings from successful bets are paid out in $HYPE, reinforcing its role as the main reward token within the ecosystem.

* **Fan Season Bonus:**
  Users who stake **Fan Tokens** for an entire season receive a boosted allocation of $HYPE. This bonus allows them to bet on every match of their team throughout the season, increasing utility and loyalty.

* **Non-Transferable:**
  $HYPE is a **non-transferable token**. It cannot be sent to other wallets or used outside of the platform. Its sole purpose is for **betting and unstaking**.

* **Unstaking Mechanism:**
  To reclaim the original CHZ or Fan Token stake, users must hold an equivalent amount of $HYPE. The unstake process burns the $HYPE and releases the underlying asset.

* **Risk Awareness:**
  If a user loses all of their $HYPE through betting, they **forfeit access to their original stake**. This introduces a real economic consequence tied to betting performance, enhancing commitment and reducing farming abuse.
