# Stake

Fanify offers two distinct staking modalities, each tailored to different user profiles and designed to maximize the utility of both **CHZ** and **Fan Tokens** within the betting ecosystem.

---

## 1. CHZ Stake ‚Äì *Single Match Bettor*

This mode is ideal for casual users who prefer one-off bets without long-term commitments.

### Flow:

1. **Stake CHZ:**
   The user stakes their CHZ tokens through the platform.

2. **Mint $HYPE:**
   In exchange, they receive an equivalent amount of $HYPE, pegged to USD (e.g., $10 worth of CHZ ‚Üí 10 $HYPE).

3. **Bet with $HYPE:**
   The $HYPE can be used to place bets on **any team, in any match** available on the platform.

4. **Unstake:**
   After the match concludes, users can **unstake** their $HYPE to reclaim a proportional amount of their original CHZ‚Äî**only if they still hold $HYPE**.

### Risk Awareness:

If a user loses all of their $HYPE in bets, **they forfeit their staked CHZ permanently**. This mechanism ensures responsible betting behavior and prevents farming abuse.

---

## 2. Fan Token Stake ‚Äì *Season Supporter Mode*

This mode is designed for committed fans who want to support their team throughout the season while earning exclusive yield and loyalty benefits.

### üîÅ Flow:

1. **Stake Fan Token:**
   The user locks Fan Tokens tied to a specific team for the duration of the season.

2. **Mint $HYPE (+50% Bonus):**
   In return, they receive $HYPE pegged to USD, plus a **+50% loyalty bonus** on the total amount minted.
   *(e.g., $100 worth of Fan Tokens ‚Üí 150 $HYPE)*

3. **Bet with Loyalty:**
   This $HYPE can **only be used to bet on the user‚Äôs chosen team** throughout the season.
   Bets are restricted to predicting **a win** or skipping the match to preserve capital. Betting against the supported team is not allowed.

4. **Unstake (Post-Season):**
   Once the season ends, the user may unstake their Fan Tokens.
   They receive:

   * A USD-equivalent return of their staked value (via $HYPE)
   * Plus any yield rewards accumulated throughout the season.
